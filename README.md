## Features

- ðŸŒ³ **Visual Git Graph**: Interactive visualization of commits, branches, and merges
- ðŸ”€ **Git Operations**: Create commits, branches, and perform merges
- ðŸŽ¯ **Node Collision Detection**: Automatic detection and prevention of overlapping nodes
- ðŸ§ª **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests and E2E tests with screenshot verification
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for detailed testing guide.

## Bug Fixes

### Node Collision Issue (Fixed âœ…)
- **Problem**: Nodes could overlap after merge operations (e.g., merging "134" into "master")
- **Solution**: Enhanced positioning algorithm with collision detection and automatic resolution
- **Details**: See [BUG_FIX_REPORT.md](./BUG_FIX_REPORT.md)

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
- **Visualization**: SVG-based git graph with drag & drop
